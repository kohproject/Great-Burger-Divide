                <h3>May Take Your Order?</h3>
                <p>People ask me all the time, "Do you miss living in Los Angeles?" My answer has always been "not really."
                    I miss the beaches, and hiking trails, but I dont really miss the lifestyle or even the weather. 
                    I do miss the the food however. California has the best variety of food in the world -- that includes fast food options.
                    I and many others would be extremely happy if they opened an "In&Out burger" somewhere in the midwest. 
                    The less famous "Rubios" Fish Tacos is also a fast food gem that you can only find in the
                    sunny states of California and Arizona.  I have heard similar stories of Texas transplants that miss Whataburgers and
                    and SouthEast transplants that have a longing for "Bojangles" 
                    fried chicken. Ironically, when I lived in Los Angeles, I would
                    crave white burgers. I thought this website would be a found project to
                  showcase the variety and locality of fast food options that is unique to the United States.
